Descripcion: 	PM based custom control sample.
Date: 		2023-05-22
Version:	1.01
----------------------------  


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This sample demonstrates how to create a PM based custom control. It was written in conjunction with an article in the Spring '93 edition of
the OS/2 Developer, "Designing Custom Controls".  All of the files required to run and/or build the demo are included.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version of this sample was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. 

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe, and the the Watcom Linker, intead of the classic ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe

3) Run "make" or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to get the log file. I also provided COMPILE.CMD to run this command.

TOOLS USED
----------
- ArcaOS	- Verion 5.0.7
- wrc 		- Version 2.0beta1
- gcc		- gcc (GCC) 9.2.0 20190812 (OS/2 RPM build 9.2.0-5.oc00)
- make 		- Version 3.81 k2 (2017-11-10)

TROUBLESHOOT
------------
The compile produce will run by just executing make on the directory, but a compile.cmd file is includes to store the log in a file. If you want to save the log file you can run it as "nmake 2>&1 |tee make.out". The log will be saved into the "make.out" file.
