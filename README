This zip file demonstrates how to create a PM based custom control.  It
was written in conjunction with an article in the Spring '93 edition of
the OS/2 Developer, "Designing Custom Controls".  All of the files required
to run and/or build the demo are included.  The makefiles are setup for
the IBM CSET/2 compiler, but you should be able to easily modify them per the
WATCOM C/386 compiler.  For more information on OS/2 and related products,
call 1-800-3IBMOS2.


Enjoy!
